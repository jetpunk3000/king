## âœ… Your bot is ready! Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `king-of-the-chat-bot` (or any name you like)
3. Make it **Public** (easier for Railway deployment)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Code to GitHub
After creating the repo, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/king-of-the-chat-bot.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

6. Add your BOT_TOKEN environment variable:
   - Go to Variables tab
   - Add: `BOT_TOKEN` = `your_actual_bot_token_from_botfather`
7. Click "Deploy"

### 4. Bot Permissions Setup
Make sure your bot has these permissions in your Telegram chat:
- âœ… Pin messages
