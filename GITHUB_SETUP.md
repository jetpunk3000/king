# ðŸš€ KING OF THE CHAT - GitHub & Render Setup

## âœ… Your bot is ready! Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `king-of-the-chat-bot` (or any name you like)
3. Make it **Public** (easier for deployment)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Code to GitHub
After creating the repo, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/king-of-the-chat-bot.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy on Render.com
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click **"New Web Service"**
4. Connect your GitHub account
5. Select your `king-of-the-chat-bot` repository
6. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: king-of-the-chat-bot (or any name)
   - **Environment**: Node
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
7. Add environment variable:
   - **Key**: `BOT_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: `your_actual_bot_token_from_botfather`
8. Click **"Create Web Service"**

### 4. Important: Use Polling (Not Webhooks)
Render.com is better with polling for Telegram bots. The bot is already configured for polling, so no additional setup needed!

### 5. Bot Permissions Setup
Make sure your bot has these permissions in your Telegram chat:
- âœ… Pin messages
- âœ… Delete messages
- âœ… Send messages

### ðŸŽ® Ready to play!

- `/king <amount>` - Start a game

- ðŸ’° CASHOUT - King withdraws (king only)

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring
